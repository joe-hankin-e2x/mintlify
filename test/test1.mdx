**_The VIONIC™ encoder series is Renishaw's highest performing incremental optical encoder. It provides digital position feedback with superior metrology, high speeds, and high reliability. VIONIC is capable of reading a wide range of linear, partial arc, and rotary scales, featuring the IN-TRAC™ auto-phase optical reference mark. The readhead integrates Renishaw's market-proven filtering optics and advanced interpolation technology. This design offers excellent dirt immunity, ultra-low sub-divisional error (SDE), and eliminates the need for extra adaptors or interfaces._**

Installation is simplified by an intuitive auto-calibration mode. The system is also compatible with optional Advanced Diagnostic Tools to aid in setup, planned maintenance, and minimizing machine downtime.

### System features

**Superior Motion Control**

VIONIC utilizes the latest interpolation algorithms and signal processing to achieve a sub-divisional error (SDE) below $\pm15$ nm. Low SDE leads to low velocity ripple, which is crucial for constant velocity applications like scanning measurement systems. The system's intelligent interpolation chip can achieve 8000x interpolation, resulting in a 2.5 nm resolution directly from the readhead. This system is ideal for applications where precision and repeatability are of paramount importance.

| System type       | SDE             |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Linear            | $<\pm15~nm$     |
| Rotary \> Ø135 mm | $<\pm15~nm^{1}$ |
| Rotary \< Ø135 mm | $<\pm20~nm$     |

_¹ With an optimized set-up,  nm SDE can be achieved. Please contact your local Renishaw representative for details._

**Higher Speed** At its maximum 50 MHz clock rate, the VIONIC readhead outputs quadrature edges with a minimum separation of 25.3 ns, enabling the highest possible speeds at fine resolutions.

**Higher Accuracy** VIONIC readheads are compatible with a variety of linear and rotary scales, ranging from $\pm1~\mu m/m$ low expansion linear spar scales to ±1 arc second total installed accuracy rings.

### Optional Advanced Diagnostic Tools

The VIONIC system is compatible with Advanced Diagnostic Tools that assist with system setup and planned maintenance, helping to reduce unscheduled machine downtime. Both the ADTpro-100 and ADTi-100 are useful for system optimization, especially when the readhead's LED is not visible. They can be used as standalone devices or in-line as part of the control loop.

**ADTpro-100** This is a handheld, standalone diagnostic tool with an integral color touch screen.

- It displays comprehensive, real-time encoder information without needing a computer.
- It is intuitive to use with plug-and-play functionality to help with system setup and calibration.
- It interfaces with the optional ADT View software, which allows encoder data to be saved.
- The ADT View software can also be used to update the ADTpro-100's firmware.

**ADTI-100** Used in conjunction with the ADT View computer software, the ADTI-100 provides:

- Comprehensive real-time feedback of encoder data to assist with challenging installations and diagnostics.
- Assistance with system setup, calibration, and signal optimization along the entire axis.
- The ability to save data, such as signal strength versus position, to record system setup and performance.
