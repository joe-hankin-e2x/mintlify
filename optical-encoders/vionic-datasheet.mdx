The VIONIC™ encoder series is Renishaw's highest performing incremental optical encoder. It provides digital position feedback with superior metrology, high speeds, and high reliability. VIONIC is capable of reading a wide range of linear, partial arc, and rotary scales, featuring the _IN-TRAC™_ auto-phase optical reference mark. The readhead integrates Renishaw's market-proven filtering optics and advanced interpolation technology. This design offers excellent dirt immunity, ultra-low sub-divisional error (SDE), and eliminates the need for extra adaptors or interfaces.

Installation is simplified by an intuitive auto-calibration mode. The system is also compatible with optional Advanced Diagnostic Tools to aid in setup, planned maintenance, and minimizing machine downtime.

### System features

**Superior Motion Control**

VIONIC utilizes the latest interpolation algorithms and signal processing to achieve a sub-divisional error (SDE) below $\pm15$ nm. Low SDE leads to low velocity ripple, which is crucial for constant velocity applications like scanning measurement systems. The system's intelligent interpolation chip can achieve 8000x interpolation, resulting in a 2.5 nm resolution directly from the readhead. This system is ideal for applications where precision and repeatability are of paramount importance.

| System type       | SDE             |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Linear            | $<\pm15~nm$     |
| Rotary \> Ø135 mm | $<\pm15~nm^{1}$ |
| Rotary \< Ø135 mm | $<\pm20~nm$     |

_¹ With an optimized set-up,  nm SDE can be achieved. Please contact your local Renishaw representative for details._

**Higher Speed** At its maximum 50 MHz clock rate, the VIONIC readhead outputs quadrature edges with a minimum separation of 25.3 ns, enabling the highest possible speeds at fine resolutions.

**Higher Accuracy** VIONIC readheads are compatible with a variety of linear and rotary scales, ranging from $\pm1~\mu m/m$ low expansion linear spar scales to ±1 arc second total installed accuracy rings.

### Optional Advanced Diagnostic Tools

The VIONIC system is compatible with Advanced Diagnostic Tools that assist with system setup and planned maintenance, helping to reduce unscheduled machine downtime. Both the ADTpro-100 and ADTi-100 are useful for system optimization, especially when the readhead's LED is not visible. They can be used as standalone devices or in-line as part of the control loop.

**ADTpro-100** This is a handheld, standalone diagnostic tool with an integral color touch screen.

- It displays comprehensive, real-time encoder information without needing a computer.
- It is intuitive to use with plug-and-play functionality to help with system setup and calibration.
- It interfaces with the optional ADT View software, which allows encoder data to be saved.
- The ADT View software can also be used to update the ADTpro-100's firmware.

**ADTI-100** Used in conjunction with the ADT View computer software, the ADTI-100 provides:

- Comprehensive real-time feedback of encoder data to assist with challenging installations and diagnostics.
- Assistance with system setup, calibration, and signal optimization along the entire axis.
- The ability to save data, such as signal strength versus position, to record system setup and performance.

For more details, refer to the ADTpro-100 data sheet (L-9518-0078), ADTI-100 data sheet (L-9517-9699), and ADT View software user guide (M-6195-9413).

### Electrical Connections and Output Specifications

#### Electrical Connections

- **Grounding**: The cable shield must be connected to the machine earth (Field Ground).
- **Cables**: The maximum readhead cable length is 10 m. For cables longer than 3 m, an active PCB is included in the D-type connector and must not be removed. The maximum cable length between the readhead and the Advanced Diagnostic Tool is also 10 m.
- **Remote CAL**: Remote operation of the calibration/AGC is possible via the CAL signal line.

#### Recommended Signal Termination

- **Digital Outputs**: Use a standard RS422A line receiver. Termination should be done with a 120Ω resistor between the differential pairs (e.g., A+ and A-). Capacitors are recommended for improved noise immunity.
- **Alarm/Limit Outputs**: These are open collector outputs and are not available with the 9-way D-type ('A') connector. The limit output requires a pull-up resistor (R) selected to ensure the maximum current does not exceed 20 mA.

#### Output Specifications

- **Form**: Square wave differential line driver to EIA RS422A.
- **Incremental**: Two channels, A and B, in quadrature (90° phase shifted).
- **Reference (Z)**: A synchronised pulse with a duration equal to the resolution. The calibrated reference mark is bi-directionally repeatable.
- **Limits (P, Q)**: Asynchronous, active high, open collector outputs with a repeatability of \< 0.1 mm.
- **Alarm (E)**: A line-driven or 3-state signal asserted when the signal amplitude is too low (\<20%) or too high (\>135%), or if the readhead speed is too high for reliable operation.
